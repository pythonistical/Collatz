# Collatz-conjucture
Solving the hardest mathematical problem through brute force, on your computer! This program takes a shot at solving collatz conjucture, also known as the 3x+1 problem through brute force. To know more, visit https://www.mathematicalgemstones.com/gemstones/the-3x1 this will give you a brief understanding of the 3x+1 problem. This code will inform you at every step that on which number it is testing and, incase after hours of brute forcing you find a number which has been in the cycle for more than 30,000 times, this program will let you know about it. You will be asked to set a limit, that means that if you incase want to keep you computer open for hours and want it to test only till a certain number and then stop, you will be able set the limit to that number by writing a int value. This question will be denoted by as follows - 'What is your limit?'
